# Math 515, Fall 2017

Welcome! Please visit the following course resources.

* [syllabus](syll.md)  
Here you will find links to pdf versions of the texts.
* [homework](homework.md)  
Each assignment is drafted one week before the due date, but may be adjusted slightly up to the class before the due date.
* [notes](https://github.com/scoskey/m515/raw/master/notes.pdf)  
Disclaimer: these lecture notes duplicate the information in the texts, but at the same time, are not as extensive. They are more for me than for you :) Comments are most welcome.
